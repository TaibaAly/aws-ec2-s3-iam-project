Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly hands-on AWS projects. This repository includes practical use cases using core AWS services like EC2, S3, and IAM.

Each project is placed in its own folder with detailed steps, screenshots, and outcomes. These projects helped me learn cloud fundamentals and practice deploying and managing cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services.
